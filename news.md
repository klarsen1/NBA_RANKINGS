----------

-   Ran the model with data up till 2016-11-26.
-   New feature: removing injured players and capturing dates players are expected to return from injury. If the return date is not available -- e.g., due to game-day decision -- I hold the player out for one day.
-   Fixed bug that caused forecasts (not back-casts) to miss the data from the last actual game day.
